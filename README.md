# Discord Bot Monitor
This is 2.0 version of the Rxiqi Bot Monitor.

I am the developer of the Thunderstruck Discord Bot.

I decided to make this monitor code to monitor the presence status of Thunderstruck to alert my users/supporters of Thunderstruck of when the bot is Online or Offline or down for maintenance.

It is my great pleasure to share this bit of code with the community to learn from it and make it better.

# Usage
Install the required node modules
`npm i discord.js`
then fill in the 'config.js' with the relative information for the monitor to monitor your bot.

Once you have done the above open up Command Prompt or Powershell and type `node monitor` and it will load the script,
make sure to invite the monitor bot your discord server first and that the bot its monitoring is in the same guild.

Leave this script running 24/7 to ensure 24/7 Monitoring.
